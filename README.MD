# INTRODUCTION

This is a handwritten numeral recognition project.The data contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.
